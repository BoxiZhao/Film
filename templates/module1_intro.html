<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Film photography is a worthwhile pursuit that emphasises intentionality.  By limiting the shots per roll and removing instant feedback, film forces you to slow down, study the light, and compose carefully.</p>
<p>Differences from digital include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Latent image</strong> – exposure is recorded chemically and revealed later in development.</li>
  <li><strong>Dynamic range</strong> – colour‑negative film handles highlights gracefully.</li>
  <li><strong>Film stock character</strong> – each emulsion has unique colour and grain.</li>
</ul>
